#  **File-Based ETL Pipeline in Java**

##  **General Idea**

This project is a simple yet scalable **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built with Java. It reads structured data from files, applies transformations, and loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline is designed to demonstrate the core ETL concepts often used in data engineering, providing a solid foundation for handling real-world data workflows.

**Key Phases of the ETL Pipeline:**

* **Extract:** Reads data from files (e.g., CSV).
* **Transform:** Applies basic data cleaning or transformations.
* **Load:** Inserts transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.

The project follows a modular structure, making it easy to extend, modify, and integrate with larger data processing systems.

##  **Future Improvements (Short Checklist)**

* [ ] Add unit and integration tests with JUnit
* [ ] Improve error handling and validation
* [ ] Batch inserts to enhance database performance
* [ ] Replace `System.out.println` with structured logging (SLF4J/Logback)
* [ ] Support multiple file formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
* [ ] Make transformations configurable (e.g., rules from a config file)
* [ ] Dockerize the application for easier deployment
* [ ] Add retry logic for database connection failures
* [ ] Implement monitoring/metrics for ETL performance
* [ ] Parallel processing for large datasets

## **Quick Start**

1. Set up your database and input files.
2. Configure database credentials via environment variables.
3. Build the project with:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the ETL pipeline:

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```
